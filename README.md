## About the Project

Georisk is a webapp based on [Georisque Government API](https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-georisques) to display risks for a selected location. The mission is to democratize risk analysis . The objective is to create a user-friendly and inclusive platform, allowing everyone to visualize and stay informed about constant risk evoltion in area.

## Risks Analysed

### Flooding 💧

Flooding occurs when water surpasses its normal boundaries, often due to heavy rain or other factors. The risk lies in potential harm, including property damage, displacement, and threats to lives, which can be mitigated through measures like improved infrastructure, zoning rules, and early warnings.

### Earthquakes ⛰️

Earthquakes are the result of tectonic plate movements, causing the ground to shake. The risk involves structural damage, injury, and disruption to communities. Mitigating measures, such as earthquake-resistant buildings, preparedness plans, and early warning systems, help reduce the impact of seismic events.

### Avalanches ❄️

Avalanches are rapid downhill movements of snow, ice, and debris, often triggered by factors like snow accumulation, weather conditions, or human activities. The risk associated with avalanches includes potential destruction to infrastructure, danger to individuals, and disruption of transportation.

### Volcanic Eruptions 🌋

A volcano is a geological feature where magma, ash, and gases erupt from the Earth's crust. The associated risk involves the potential for lava flow, ashfall, and volcanic gases, impacting nearby communities and ecosystems.

### Forest Fires 🔥

A forest fire is an uncontrolled blaze that spreads rapidly through wooded areas, fueled by dry conditions, wind, or human activities. The risk encompasses damage to ecosystems, wildlife habitats, and the threat to human lives and property.

### Weather Troubles ⛈️

Weather troubles refer to adverse atmospheric conditions that can lead to various hazards such as storms, floods, and extreme temperatures. The associated risks include property damage, disruptions to transportation, and threats to public safety.

### Radon ⚛️

Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas that can seep into buildings from the ground, posing a health risk. The danger lies in long-term exposure, as radon is a leading cause of lung cancer, especially in enclosed spaces.

### Industrials Risks 🏭

Industrial risks refer to potential hazards associated with manufacturing, processing, or handling of materials in various industries. These risks include accidents, chemical spills, and equipment failures, posing threats to worker safety, public health, and the environment

### Nuclear Risks ☢️

In the context of energy or weapons, nuclear refers to processes involving the nucleus of an atom. The associated risks primarily pertain to nuclear accidents, radiation exposure, and the potential for catastrophic events.

### Dam Breaks 🌊

A dam break occurs when a dam, typically holding water, fails to contain the water, leading to uncontrolled release. The risks involve rapid flooding downstream, posing threats to communities, infrastructure, and the environment.

### Dangerous Transport 🚛

Dangerous transport involves the movement of hazardous materials, posing risks to public safety and the environment. The associated dangers include accidents, spills, and exposure to harmful substances during transportation.

### War Engines/Object 💣

A war engine typically refers to military machinery or technology designed for warfare. The associated risks include armed conflicts, destruction, and loss of lives.

### Mining Risks ⚒️

Mining activities entail various hazards that can impact the environment, workers, and surrounding communities. Risks include accidents, ground subsidence, and pollution from mining operations.
